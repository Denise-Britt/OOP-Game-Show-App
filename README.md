OOP Game Show App


I've created a browser-based, word guessing game using JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). My code selects a random, hidden phrase, which player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

My code chooses a random phrase, splits the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the gameboard.

Each time player guesses a letter, my code compares the letter player has chosen with the random phrase. If letter is in the phrase, gameboard displays chosen letters on the screen.

Player continues to select letters until they guess phrase (and win), or make five incorrect guesses (and lose).

If player completes phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen appears. If player guesses incorrectly five times, a losing screen appears.

Player can guess a letter only once. After theyâ€™ve guessed a letter, my programming will disable that letter on the onscreen keyboard.
